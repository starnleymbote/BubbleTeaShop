Order Tea App

## Getting Started

This is a simple app that allows the user to see all available drinks

Then on picking a drink they can customize the level of sweetness, ice and pearls on the tea and then add it to cart

From there they will see the item in the card and try to checkout.

They checkout is not functional at the moment. 

Key lesson for creating this was to learn how to use provider in flutter
